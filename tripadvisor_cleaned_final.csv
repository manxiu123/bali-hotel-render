This is the quiet and unspoilt and less commercial side of Bali. It is a magical area, one where nature and humanity co-exist in perfect harmony, yet is less than three hours’ drive from Kuta and Seminyak. Mayo Resort is the ideal venue for a truly relaxing holiday, or short break, and a spectacular but very practical location for private celebrations or corporate events. We are located at the tip of a headland, where the Bali Sea surrounds us on three sides. We are blessed with stunning views of the sea in one direction, and in the other mountains, temples, rice fields and vineyards. Not to mention miles of almost-deserted beaches. It is a truly privileged location; a neighbourhood of luxury resorts, and exclusive private villas, set amid rolling hills, this area has long been a refuge for those seeking inner peace and meditation, and is now becoming known as a destination for wellness tourism - yoga sessions, traditional Chinese medicine and detox programmes, are all available within a few minutes'walk. Only the coral reefs lie in between you and the resplendent blue of the sea. With a shoreline stretching the entire length of our property, and the Purijati diving area only a short walk away, you will enjoy an intimate connection with the water that few other resorts or hotels can offer. We live in a rainshadow, so we enjoy an unusually sunny and dry microclimate, at the same time we are tempered by the cool sea breezes The sunsets will mesmerize you; each day you will be witness to a three-hour long ritual that begins when the sun has fallen low enough to reflect off the sea and create a shimmering light that will raise your spirits and enhance your well-being, and which lasts until a fiery red disc sinks below the volcanos of east Java and the rolling hills of west Bali in the far distance. Our Accommodation comprises 4 double-bed and 1 twin-bed Studio rooms, a 2-bedroom family apartment and a 2-bedroom villa in its own private setting. All our rooms have unobstructed panoramic ocean views, with lush gardens and a swimming pool in the foreground. All are large enough to accommodate an additional bed if needed.
